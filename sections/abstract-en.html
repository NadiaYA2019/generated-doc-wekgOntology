<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The WeKG ontology is a modular ontology that re-uses and extends standard ontologies, such as GeoSPARQL ontology for spatial features,  the Time ontology for temporal entities, the Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) and Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontologies for sensors and observations. Individuals of Weather Property and Meteorological Feature classes are declared in a separate namespace as skos:Concept. 

The WeKG ontology and vocabulary are generic enough to be adopted and extended by meteorological data providers to publish and integrate their sources while complying with Linked Data principles.</span>
